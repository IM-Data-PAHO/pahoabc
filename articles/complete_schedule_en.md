# Complete Schedule Coverage

## Rationale

The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate whether the target
population has been fully vaccinated according to the country’s defined
immunization schedule for a specific location, cohort and age.

Imagine the Republic of “ImmunoNation.” In ImmunoNation, a complete
immunization schedule for a child might include the following:

- *At birth*: 1 dose of the BCG vaccine (which protects against
  tuberculosis).
- *During the first 11 months*: 3 doses of a vaccine containing DTP
  (this combination vaccine protects against Diphtheria, Tetanus, and
  Pertussis).
- *At 12 months*: 1 dose of the MMR vaccine (which protects against
  Measles, Mumps, and Rubella).
- *At some point in childhood*: 1 dose of the yellow fever vaccine.

This is just an example of what a complete immunization schedule could
look like in a country like ImmunoNation. Each country defines the
vaccines and the number of doses needed to protect its population from
different diseases.

To construct this indicator, it is essential to assess if each
individual received all doses specified in the schedule.

> All functions used for complete schedule coverage analyses within
> PAHOabc begin with the `cs_` prefix.

## Glossary

### Political Geographic Boundaries

Throughout this vignette, we will make reference to different levels of
political geographic boundaries. These levels are defined by the
country/territory and can have different names from country to country.
PAHOabc is agnostic to these names and requires the user to recode their
variable names to fit the PAHOabc structure.

Namely, PAHOabc can distinguish three administrative levels, which
listed from top to bottom level are: ADM0, ADM1 and ADM2.

1.  ADM0: The country. This is the top-most administrative level.
2.  ADM1: The first geographic subdivision in the country. ADM0 contains
    several ADM1 subdivisions.
3.  ADM2: The second geographic subdivision in the country. Each ADM1
    contains several ADM2 subdivisions.

### Vaccine Names

Our example datasets use a specific naming convention for the vaccine
doses. This might not match your own naming schemes, but it will not
affect the usage of the package as long as you make sure to be
consistent when naming vaccine doses.

For example, the vaccine names used in the PAHOabc package are:

| Abbreviation | Full Name                                             |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| SRP1         | Measles, Rubella, and Mumps Vaccine (1st dose)        |
| DTP1         | Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Pertussis Vaccine (1st dose) |
| DTP2         | Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Pertussis Vaccine (2nd dose) |
| DTP3         | Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Pertussis Vaccine (3rd dose) |
| BCG RN       | Bacillus Calmette–Guérin Vaccine (at birth)           |
| YFV1         | Yellow Fever Vaccine (1st dose)                       |

## Usage

### Install Package

The first step to run the residence occurrence analyses is to install
the PAHOabc package available on GitHub.

``` r
devtools::install_github("IM-Data-PAHO/pahoabc")
```

### Load Data

The functions in this module require you to provide three datasets in a
specific format.

1.  Your EIR.
2.  The vaccination schedule related to this EIR.
3.  A table with population denominators depending on the geographic
    level of your analysis.
    1.  This is optional for the
        [`cs_coverage()`](https://im-data-paho.github.io/pahoabc/reference/cs_coverage.md)
        function (but not shown in this vignette).

To make it easy for you to test out PAHOabc’s functionality and
understand the structure we require for your datasets, we will now
explore the example datasets provided by PAHOabc that are required by
this module.

#### EIR

The
[`pahoabc::pahoabc.EIR`](https://im-data-paho.github.io/pahoabc/reference/pahoabc.EIR.md)
data frame provides a simulated, nominal-level table representing
individual vaccination events from an Electronic Immunization Registry
(EIR). Each row corresponds to a single vaccination act for a person,
including information on their residence, where they were vaccinated
(occurrence), their date of birth, and the vaccine dose received.

``` r
pahoabc.EIR %>% head() %>% kable(caption = "Example Electronic Immunization Registry")
```

|     ID | date_birth | date_vax   | ADM1_residence | ADM2_residence | ADM1_occurrence | ADM2_occurrence | dose   |
|-------:|:-----------|:-----------|:---------------|:---------------|:----------------|:----------------|:-------|
| 191997 | 2023-08-08 | 2023-12-26 | ADM1_4         | ADM2_4_35      | ADM1_4          | ADM2_4_35       | DTP2   |
| 212189 | 2023-12-20 | 2023-12-26 | ADM1_5         | ADM2_5_61      | ADM1_5          | ADM2_5_61       | BCG RN |
| 118063 | 2022-09-15 | 2023-12-26 | ADM1_2         | ADM2_2_5       | ADM1_2          | ADM2_2_5        | DTP1   |
| 118063 | 2022-09-15 | 2023-12-26 | ADM1_2         | ADM2_2_5       | ADM1_2          | ADM2_2_5        | YFV1   |
| 130751 | 2022-10-27 | 2023-12-12 | ADM1_5         | ADM2_5_55      | ADM1_5          | ADM2_5_55       | YFV1   |
| 136532 | 2021-09-21 | 2023-12-26 | ADM1_3         | ADM2_3_12      | ADM1_3          | ADM2_3_12       | SRP1   |

Example Electronic Immunization Registry

- `ID`: Unique person identification number.
- `date_birth`: Date of birth of person.
- `date_vax`: Date of vaccination event.
- ADM1: Refers to the first geographic administrative level of the
  country.
- ADM2: Refers to the second geographic administrative level of the
  country.
- Residence: Refers to the place where the person lives.  
- Occurrence: Refers to the place where the vaccination event
  occurred.  
- `dose`: A combined variable representing the vaccine type and its
  corresponding dose number. For example, DTP1 refers to the first dose
  of a vaccine containing diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis components.

#### Vaccination Schedule

The
[`pahoabc::pahoabc.schedule`](https://im-data-paho.github.io/pahoabc/reference/pahoabc.schedule.md)
dataset defines the national immunization schedule, listing each vaccine
dose and its recommended age of administration (in days). It helps the
package determine whether an individual is up to date with their
vaccinations.

``` r
pahoabc.schedule %>% kable(caption = "Example Immunization Schedule")
```

| dose   | age_schedule | age_schedule_low | age_schedule_high |
|:-------|-------------:|-----------------:|------------------:|
| SRP1   |          365 |              360 |               420 |
| DTP1   |           60 |               54 |                90 |
| DTP2   |          120 |              116 |               150 |
| DTP3   |          180 |              176 |               210 |
| BCG RN |            0 |                0 |                28 |
| YFV1   |          365 |              360 |               420 |

Example Immunization Schedule

- `dose`: A combined variable representing the vaccine type and its
  corresponding dose number. For example, DTP1 refers to the first dose
  of a vaccine containing diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis components.
- `age_schedule`: The recommended age of administration of the
  corresponding `dose` in days.
- `age_schedule_low`: The lower limit for the target age in days.
- `age_schedule_high`: The upper limit for the target age in days.

> **Note**
>
> The `dose` names must match exactly those in the `dose` column of the
> `pahoabc.EIR` dataset.

#### Population Denominators

This module will require you to provide a table with population
denominators. The geographic level of this table will be directly
dependent on the geographic level of your analysis. For example, if you
were to perform an analysis at ADM1 level, the required population
denominator table must contain the following.

``` r
pahoabc.pop.ADM1 %>% head() %>% kable(caption = "Example Population at ADM1")
```

| ADM1   | year | age | population |
|:-------|-----:|----:|-----------:|
| ADM1_1 | 2022 |   0 |   1718.189 |
| ADM1_1 | 2022 |   1 |   1808.964 |
| ADM1_1 | 2023 |   0 |   1703.145 |
| ADM1_1 | 2023 |   1 |   1792.443 |
| ADM1_2 | 2022 |   0 |   6575.261 |
| ADM1_2 | 2022 |   1 |   6922.644 |

Example Population at ADM1

Note that this table is in long format and contains the corresponding
`population` of children of a specific `age` during a given `year` for a
certain `ADM1` level.

### Complete Schedule Coverage Analysis

#### Expected Workflow

The
[`cs_coverage()`](https://im-data-paho.github.io/pahoabc/reference/cs_coverage.md),
[`cs_barplot()`](https://im-data-paho.github.io/pahoabc/reference/cs_barplot.md)
and
[`cs_upsetplot()`](https://im-data-paho.github.io/pahoabc/reference/cs_upsetplot.md)
functions provide a way of analyzing and visualizing complete schedule
coverage. Their relationships are shown in Figure 1.

![Figure 1. Expected workflow for complete schedule coverage
analysis.](cs_workflow.svg)

Figure 1. Expected workflow for complete schedule coverage analysis.

  

#### Example

Below is a simplified example of the calculation of complete schedule
coverage for the first subnational administrative level, focusing on the
birth cohort of the year 2022.

``` r
# compute coverage
coverage_df <- cs_coverage(
  data.EIR = pahoabc.EIR,
  data.schedule = pahoabc.schedule,
  geo_level = "ADM1",
  birth_cohorts = 2022 # this can be a vector of years
)

# show results in table
coverage_df %>%
  kable(digits = 2, caption = "Complete schedule coverage by ADM1 level")
```

| year | ADM1   | numerator | population | coverage |
|-----:|:-------|----------:|-----------:|---------:|
| 2022 | ADM1_1 |       406 |       1733 |    23.43 |
| 2022 | ADM1_2 |      1145 |      12428 |     9.21 |
| 2022 | ADM1_3 |      6508 |      50238 |    12.95 |
| 2022 | ADM1_4 |      1355 |       6382 |    21.23 |
| 2022 | ADM1_5 |       735 |       3488 |    21.07 |

Complete schedule coverage by ADM1 level

#### Bar plot

It is possible to display the previously obtained results in a bar plot
with
[`cs_barplot()`](https://im-data-paho.github.io/pahoabc/reference/cs_barplot.md).

``` r
# visualize output from cs_coverage()
coverage_plot <- cs_barplot(data = coverage_df)

# show
coverage_plot
```

![](complete_schedule_en_files/figure-html/cov-viz-example-1.png)

#### Upset plot

The
[`cs_upsetplot()`](https://im-data-paho.github.io/pahoabc/reference/cs_upsetplot.md)
function allows us to produce an upset plot to evaluate the percentage
of individuals included in the EIR who have received any of the possible
combinations of the available vaccines. The orange bar represents the
proportion of individuals who have received all the evaluated vaccines,
thus indicating the complete schedule coverage. The horizontal bars show
the proportion of individuals who received each specific vaccine (i.e.,
the coverage for that vaccine).

``` r
# produce upset plot
coverage_upset <- cs_upsetplot(
  data.EIR = pahoabc.EIR,
  data.schedule = pahoabc.schedule,
  birth_cohort = 2022
)
```

    ## Warning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.
    ## ℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.
    ## ℹ The deprecated feature was likely used in the ComplexUpset package.
    ##   Please report the issue at
    ##   <https://github.com/krassowski/complex-upset/issues>.
    ## This warning is displayed once per session.

``` r
# show
coverage_upset
```

![](complete_schedule_en_files/figure-html/cov-upset-example-1.png)

In the example the complete schedule coverage reached 13.7% and is
represented by the orange bar.

It is noteworthy that 24.1% of individuals in the EIR received only the
BCG vaccine, and that the third most frequent combination (9.1%)
consists of individuals who received all other vaccines except BCG. This
could indicate an error in recording a newborn’s BCG vaccine using
temporary identification numbers.
