# Using our Example Datasets

## Rationale

The PAHOabc package includes a set of example datasets to help users
understand how to use its functions effectively. These datasets simulate
a fictional country’s immunization information system and are structured
to work seamlessly with the tools provided by the package. This vignette
provides an overview of each dataset and describes how they are used
throughout the package’s modules.

## Glossary

### Political Geographic Boundaries

Throughout this vignette, we will make reference to different levels of
political geographic boundaries. These levels are defined by the
country/territory and can have different names from country to country.
PAHOabc is agnostic to these names and requires the user to recode their
variable names to fit the PAHOabc structure.

Namely, PAHOabc can distinguish three administrative levels, which
listed from top to bottom level are: ADM0, ADM1 and ADM2.

1.  ADM0: The country. This is the top-most administrative level.
2.  ADM1: The first geographic subdivision in the country. ADM0 contains
    several ADM1 subdivisions.
3.  ADM2: The second geographic subdivision in the country. Each ADM1
    contains several ADM2 subdivisions.

### Vaccine Names

Our example datasets use a specific naming convention for the vaccine
doses. This might not match your own naming schemes, but it will not
affect the usage of the package as long as you make sure to be
consistent when naming vaccine doses.

For example, the vaccine names used in the PAHOabc package are:

| Abbreviation | Full Name                                             |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| SRP1         | Measles, Rubella, and Mumps Vaccine (1st dose)        |
| DTP1         | Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Pertussis Vaccine (1st dose) |
| DTP2         | Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Pertussis Vaccine (2nd dose) |
| DTP3         | Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Pertussis Vaccine (3rd dose) |
| BCG RN       | Bacillus Calmette–Guérin Vaccine (at birth)           |
| YFV1         | Yellow Fever Vaccine (1st dose)                       |

## List of example datasets

### pahoabc.EIR

The
[`pahoabc::pahoabc.EIR`](https://im-data-paho.github.io/pahoabc/reference/pahoabc.EIR.md)
dataframe is the most important dataset in the package. It is a
nominal-level table representing individual vaccination events from an
Electronic Immunization Registry (EIR). Each row corresponds to a single
vaccination act for a person, including information on their residence,
where they were vaccinated, their date of birth, and the vaccine dose
received.

``` r
pahoabc.EIR %>% head() %>% kable(caption = "Example Electronic Immunization Registry")
```

|     ID | date_birth | date_vax   | ADM1_residence | ADM2_residence | ADM1_occurrence | ADM2_occurrence | dose   |
|-------:|:-----------|:-----------|:---------------|:---------------|:----------------|:----------------|:-------|
| 191997 | 2023-08-08 | 2023-12-26 | ADM1_4         | ADM2_4_35      | ADM1_4          | ADM2_4_35       | DTP2   |
| 212189 | 2023-12-20 | 2023-12-26 | ADM1_5         | ADM2_5_61      | ADM1_5          | ADM2_5_61       | BCG RN |
| 118063 | 2022-09-15 | 2023-12-26 | ADM1_2         | ADM2_2_5       | ADM1_2          | ADM2_2_5        | DTP1   |
| 118063 | 2022-09-15 | 2023-12-26 | ADM1_2         | ADM2_2_5       | ADM1_2          | ADM2_2_5        | YFV1   |
| 130751 | 2022-10-27 | 2023-12-12 | ADM1_5         | ADM2_5_55      | ADM1_5          | ADM2_5_55       | YFV1   |
| 136532 | 2021-09-21 | 2023-12-26 | ADM1_3         | ADM2_3_12      | ADM1_3          | ADM2_3_12       | SRP1   |

Example Electronic Immunization Registry

- `ID`: Unique person identification number.
- `date_birth`: Date of birth of person.
- `date_vax`: Date of vaccination event.
- ADM1: Refers to the first geographic administrative level of the
  country.
- ADM2: Refers to the second geographic administrative level of the
  country.
- Residence: Refers to the place where the person lives.  
- Occurrence: Refers to the place where the vaccination event
  occurred.  
- `dose`: A combined variable representing the vaccine type and its
  corresponding dose number. For example, DTP1 refers to the first dose
  of a vaccine containing diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis components.

### pahoabc.schedule

The
[`pahoabc::pahoabc.schedule`](https://im-data-paho.github.io/pahoabc/reference/pahoabc.schedule.md)
dataset defines the national immunization schedule, listing each vaccine
dose and its recommended age of administration (in days). It helps the
package determine whether an individual is up to date with their
vaccinations.

``` r
pahoabc.schedule %>% kable(caption = "Example Immunization Schedule")
```

| dose   | age_schedule | age_schedule_low | age_schedule_high |
|:-------|-------------:|-----------------:|------------------:|
| SRP1   |          365 |              360 |               420 |
| DTP1   |           60 |               54 |                90 |
| DTP2   |          120 |              116 |               150 |
| DTP3   |          180 |              176 |               210 |
| BCG RN |            0 |                0 |                28 |
| YFV1   |          365 |              360 |               420 |

Example Immunization Schedule

- `dose`: A combined variable representing the vaccine type and its
  corresponding dose number. For example, DTP1 refers to the first dose
  of a vaccine containing diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis components.
- `age_schedule`: The recommended age of administration of the
  corresponding `dose` in days.
- `age_schedule_low`: The lower limit for the target age in days.
- `age_schedule_high`: The upper limit for the target age in days.

> **Note**
>
> The `dose` names must match exactly those in the `dose` column of the
> `pahoabc.EIR` dataset.

### Population Datasets

Population datasets provide population estimates at different geographic
levels, for various years and children of varying ages. Depending on the
geographic level at which we want to perform an analysis, PAHOabc may
require you to provide the corresponding population to use as a
denominator (mainly for coverage analyses).

#### pahoabc.pop.ADM0

The
[`pahoabc::pahoabc.pop.ADM0`](https://im-data-paho.github.io/pahoabc/reference/pahoabc.pop.ADM0.md)
dataset provides aggregated population estimates at the national level
(ADM0).

``` r
pahoabc.pop.ADM0 %>% kable(caption = "Example Population at ADM0")
```

| year | age | population |
|-----:|----:|-----------:|
| 2022 |   0 |   45846.71 |
| 2022 |   1 |   48268.88 |
| 2023 |   0 |   45445.28 |
| 2023 |   1 |   47828.03 |

Example Population at ADM0

This table is in long format and contains the corresponding `population`
of children of a specific `age` during a given `year`.

#### pahoabc.pop.ADM1

The
[`pahoabc::pahoabc.pop.ADM1`](https://im-data-paho.github.io/pahoabc/reference/pahoabc.pop.ADM1.md)
dataset provides population data aggregated at the first subnational
administrative level (ADM1), typically corresponding to regions,
provinces, or states.

``` r
pahoabc.pop.ADM1 %>% head() %>% kable(caption = "Example Population at ADM1")
```

| ADM1   | year | age | population |
|:-------|-----:|----:|-----------:|
| ADM1_1 | 2022 |   0 |   1718.189 |
| ADM1_1 | 2022 |   1 |   1808.964 |
| ADM1_1 | 2023 |   0 |   1703.145 |
| ADM1_1 | 2023 |   1 |   1792.443 |
| ADM1_2 | 2022 |   0 |   6575.261 |
| ADM1_2 | 2022 |   1 |   6922.644 |

Example Population at ADM1

Note that this table is in long format and contains the corresponding
`population` of children of a specific `age` during a given `year` at
the `ADM1` level.

#### pahoabc.pop.ADM2

The
[`pahoabc::pahoabc.pop.ADM2`](https://im-data-paho.github.io/pahoabc/reference/pahoabc.pop.ADM2.md)
dataset provides more granular population data by both ADM1 and ADM2
levels, allowing analyses at a finer geographic resolution.

``` r
pahoabc.pop.ADM2 %>% head() %>% kable(caption = "Example Population at ADM2")
```

| ADM1   | ADM2      | year | age | population |
|:-------|:----------|-----:|----:|-----------:|
| ADM1_4 | ADM2_4_29 | 2022 |   0 |   755.3488 |
| ADM1_4 | ADM2_4_29 | 2022 |   1 |   795.2554 |
