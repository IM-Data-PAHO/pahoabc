#' (V)accination (T)imeliness Cumulative Distribution Plot
#'
#' Generates a plot of the cumulative percentage vaccinated since the start of the timeliness window, faceted by \code{dose}.
#'
#' The timeliness window of each dose is shaded. If \code{data} is disaggregated by geographic area, each area is drawn as a thin grey line for context, and all areas combined are drawn as a single highlighted line. Specific areas can be highlighted in color with \code{highlight}. Records vaccinated before the timeliness window and records with a missing date are excluded from the distribution and reported in the caption.
#'
#' @param data The output from the \code{pahoabc::vt_distribution} function.
#' @param percentile Numeric (optional). A single percentile (greater than 0 and at most 100) to highlight in the plot. This is inserted as a label for all highlighted areas and for the combined plot. Default is \code{NULL}, which highlights nothing.
#' @param highlight Character (optional). Up to 5 geographic areas to highlight in color. Only available when \code{data} is disaggregated by "ADM1" or "ADM2". Default is \code{NULL}, which highlights nothing.
#' @param within_ADM1 Character (optional). When analyzing data at the "ADM2" level, this optional character vector lets you specify one or several "ADM1" to filter. Default is \code{NULL}, which means no filtering by "ADM1".
#' @param max_days Numeric (optional). Maximum number of days since the start of the timeliness window to show on the x-axis, useful to trim long tails of late vaccinations. Default is \code{NULL}, which shows up to the day at which 95\% of records are vaccinated.
#' @param x_axis Character. Either "absolute" (default), where the x-axis shows the age at vaccination in days, starting at the \code{age_schedule_low} of each dose; or "relative", where the x-axis shows the days since the start of the timeliness window, starting at 0 for every dose.
