#' (V)accination (T)imeliness Percentiles
#'
#' This function calculates the number of days since the start of the timeliness window needed to vaccinate a given percentage of the analyzed records, for each \code{dose} and geographic area present in \code{data}.
#'
#' @param data The output from the \code{pahoabc::vt_distribution} function. The disaggregation is inherited from this data.
#' @param percentiles Numeric. A vector of percentiles (greater than 0 and at most 100) to calculate. Default is \code{c(25, 50, 75)}.
#'
#' @return A data frame with one row per \code{percentile} for each \code{dose} and geographic area, with the following columns:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item \code{percentile}: the percentile.
#'   \item \code{day}: first day since the start of the timeliness window at which the cumulative percentage vaccinated (\code{cdf}) reaches the percentile.
#'   \item \code{age}: age in days at which the percentile is reached (\code{day + age_schedule_low}).
#'   \item \code{within_window}: whether \code{day} falls within the timeliness window for that dose.
#'   \item \code{window_end}: last timely day for that dose.
#'   \item \code{total}: number of vaccinations in the EIR for that \code{dose} and geographic area, excluding those vaccinated before the timeliness window and those with a missing date.
#' }
#' It can be passed to \code{vt_percentile_plot}.
