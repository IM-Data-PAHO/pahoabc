\title{Calculate Vaccine Coverage by Residence and Occurrence}
\usage{
residence_occurrence(
  data.EIR,
  data.schedule,
  data.pop,
  year_analysis,
  vaccines,
  geo_level
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data.EIR}{A data frame containing electronic immunization registry data.}

\item{data.schedule}{A data frame with the vaccination schedule, including target age for each dose.}

\item{data.pop}{A data frame with population data by geographic level, year, and age group.}

\item{year_analysis}{The year for which the coverage calculation is being done.}

\item{vaccines}{A character vector specifying the doses to include in the analysis.}

\item{geo_level}{A character string indicating the geographic level: "ADM1" or "ADM2".}
}
\value{
A data frame with calculated coverage by both residence and occurrence, including columns for
        year, dose, geographic levels (ADM1 and ADM2 if applicable), doses applied, population, coverage, and coverage type.
}
\description{
This function calculates vaccine coverage by both residence and occurrence at a specified geographic level
(ADM1 or ADM2) for a given year and set of vaccines.
}
\examples{
# Example usage:
# coverage <- residence_occurrence(data.EIR, data.schedule, data.pop, 2023, c("DTP1", "DTP3"), "ADM2")
