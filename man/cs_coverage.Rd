  data.EIR,
  data.pop,

  max_age = NA,
  birth_cohorts = NA,
  geo_level = NA
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data.EIR}{A data frame containing individual vaccination records. See \code{pahoabc.EIR} for expected structure.}

\item{data.pop}{A data frame with population denominators. See \code{pahoabc.pop.ADM0}, \code{pahoabc.pop.ADM1} or \code{pahoabc.pop.ADM2} for structure examples.}

\item{data.schedule}{A data frame defining the vaccination schedule. See \code{pahoabc.schedule} for expected structure.}

\item{max_age}{Numeric (optional). The maximum age up to which vaccination completeness is assessed. If \code{NA} (default), all doses in \code{data.schedule} are considered.}

\item{birth_cohorts}{Numeric (optional). A vector specifying the birth cohort(s) for which coverage should be calculated. If \code{NA} (default), coverage is calculated for all available years.}

\item{geo_level}{Character (optional). The geographic level to aggregate results by. Must be "ADM1", "ADM2", or \code{NA}. \code{data.pop} must contain the columns to match.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing:
\itemize{
  \item \code{year}: The birth cohort year.
  \item Geographic subdivision columns (if applicable).
  \item \code{numerator}: The number of children with a complete vaccination schedule for the given cohort and geographic level.
  \item \code{population}: The population denominator for the given cohort and geographic level.
  \item \code{coverage}: The calculated vaccination coverage as a percentage, rounded to two decimals.

\description{
This function calculates complete vaccination coverage for a given birth cohort and geographic level using electronic immunization registry (EIR) data, a vaccination schedule, and population denominators.
The function determines which individuals have received all scheduled doses up to a specified age and calculates the proportion of fully vaccinated children by year and geographic subdivision.
